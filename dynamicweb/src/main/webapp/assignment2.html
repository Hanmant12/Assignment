<p>Teaching has gone online because of Covid-19. All schools across the globe have closed and over 1.2 billion children are out of school. Online education takes place over the internet. It is also called e-learning. 



Here the students access online study materials, join virtual lectures, post questions to teachers, chat with fellow students, give virtual exams and do much more things. Online classes provide good quality of education to students in the comfort of their homes and also help in controlling virus spread. 




There is no barrier to time. They can study at their convenience. Another positive effect of online education is students have become more tech-savvy. They got to know more about various apps and programs. All the study material is safely stored in an online database. 




If students need further explanations, they can easily view these records and resolve doubts instantly. Students have a lot of options to choose an online education program. They can select subjects and topics of their interest very easily. 



But there are some drawbacks of online education. There is no face-to-face conversation between teachers and students. This puts a barrier in communication skills and personality development. 




Internet connectivity is also a big issue in some areas. Internet prices are also increasing and everyone cannot afford online education. Online education provides freedom to students which are not good for them as it lacks discipline. 




In online education, everything is scripted. It lacks emotions like laughter, excitement, or anger. Thus, there are both advantages and disadvantages of online education but in this lockdown time, this is truly helpful in providing continuous and uninterrupted learning.
